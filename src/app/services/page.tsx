Ife did a wonderful job on my wedding makeup, I felt very beautiful and got lots of compliments. Not only did she listen and do everything I asked for, she was also so helpful during the busy morning including feeding me breakfast mid getting my hair done, helping me with my veil and capture some great content. I would definitely recommend!",

      "From the moment I found Glee Makeovers on Instagram and reached out, I had peace from her first response until the end. She has such a calming and reassuring presence. She listened to me every step of the way. Makeup already ate at my trial but she encouraged me to look at everything critically and make adjustments so that I’ll be 100% happy. She even bought new products to give me the exact shade of blush I wanted! On both my wedding days she went above and beyond, stepping in to help with my dresses, shoes, jewellery- and my makeup was banging! I looked like the most beautiful version of myself ever, not like someone else. I won’t stop singing her praises. Book her!",

As a makeup artist myself, there are certain qualities I look out for beyond the glam. Ife’s professionalism is top notch, she exudes grace. I didn’t book her for trial but she delivered excellently, she worked on my face as though I am a regular client. Ohh before I forget, the relaxing face massage I got before the makeup was mind blowing. My makeup stayed on for over 16 hours and it did not move despite the dance and tears.\nThank you for being a wonderful person.",
